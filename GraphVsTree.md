#### Graph
- Collection of two sets of V and E
- Vertices are nodes in the graph
- Two adjacent vertices are joined by edges
- G = {V,E}
- No root
- Each node can have any number of edges
- DFS/BFS
- A cycle can be formed
- edges can be directed or undirected
- used to find shortest path

#### Tree
- Finite set of one or more nodes
- Designated node called root
- Can form disjoint sets called subtrees
- No cycle
- edges are directed
- inorder, postorder, preorder traversal
- game trees, decision trees
