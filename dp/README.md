#### Dynamic programming 
- is an optimization approach that transforms a complex problem into a sequence of simpler problems; its essential characteristic is the multistage nature of the optimization procedure.
- optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems - bottom-up dynamic programming
- dp can also be done using memoization + recursion (top down approach)
- memoization can be done using hash tables

#### FAST
- Find the First solution
- Analyze the solution
- identify the Subproblems
- Turn around the solution
