// Minimum numbers of player chatting: Example 1:

// Input: chatOfPlayers = "chatchat"
// Output: 1
// Explanation: One player yelling "chat" twice.

// Example 2:

// Input: chatOfPlayers = "chcathat"
// Output: 2
// Explanation: The minimum number of players is two.
// The first player could yell "ch-at---".
// The second player could yell later "--c--hat".

// Random string generator:

// For game recommendation, we will collect players information as parameters, such as geolocation, age, popular games among friends, etc. Then calculate a "weight" for each game, it means the possibility the game is being recommended. And we also want players to be able to see different games every time they visit the page, so we want to add some randomization in the algorithm.
// Think of your solution as a simplified game recommendation prototype, you're given a dictionary, where the keys are strings and values are positive integers representing the weight of the key (). Write a function that returns a string randomly based on its weight.

// Example:
// Input: dictionary = {'apple': 2, 'baby': 3, 'cat': 5}
// Output: "cat"

// Input: dictionary = {'apple': 2, 'baby': 3, 'cat': 5}
// Output: "baby"
