### Binary Tree Traversals

##### Preorder
- Root, Left, Right
- Meaning process the current node now

##### Postorder
- Left, Right, Root
- Meaning process the current node at the end, after the children

##### Inorder
- Left, Root, Right
- process the current node in between

##### Heap 
- is a special Tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree.
- normally used for Priority Queue, Scheduling
- not so popular due to quick sort
- pattern: If the problem states that you need to find the smallest/largest/median elements of a set
- sample problem: Find the Median of a Number Stream (medium)

##### BST
- special tree where the left all smaller than the right
